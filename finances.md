# Economics

TeleMinx has a strict lending thesis. It will only make insured loans to underwrite contracts to buy and sell telecom credits or minutes.

Minutes are calculated as minutes per call to any destination or route worldwide. There is no buying or consignment stock - minutes are bought and sold in real time.

The borrower will utilize the funds to trade minutes via telecoms exchanges (e.g. Route trader, Verteco, DSX, etc.) and/or via insured suppliers.

The borrower can employ various strategies to negotiate and execute deals which include directs, trade credit and swaps. A direct deal is a point to point solution that delivers a very stable route and with a substantial margin advantage. Trading credit can be attained based on the trading amount of the previous day which allows the borrower to establish and grow relationships with larger entities. A swap deal is a trade of equitable minutes or minute value where minimal to no money is required for settlement between trading counterparties at the end of the trading period, which mitigates cash flow pressure.

To mitigate risk, the borrower will never buy unless the route has been pre-sold.  Thus, no stock shall accumulate nor consequential penalties incurred should traffic fail or stop for any reason and no commitment beyond the real time traffic running.

The the borrower utilizes one or more switch for implementing VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) to process the calling traffic.

### Revenue

*17%+ year interest rates on insured lending contracts to Borrowers*

### Costs

*$150,000 Seed Funding*

*$141,000 yearly fixed costs*

*1.5% yearly Administration Fee*

*Remainder split 80:20 between Token Holders and Administrator*

|          | Interest Payments | Service Provider sub-total | Administrator | Auditor  | Council | Developer | Marketer | Token Holder |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------|----------|---------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Annually | $3,374,500        | $1,025,900             | $884,900      | $100,000 | $10,000 | $25,000   | $6,000   | $2,348,600   |

Initially, the Administrator will be paid a fee of 1.5% of the fund's net asset value, as well as a performance bonus of 20% all dividends issued.

It is estimated that the Auditor will cost $25,000 at launch and $100,000 per year.

Initial legal costs by the Council are estimated at $10,000. And additionally, a $10,000 per year retainer will be paid to the Council, for arbitration and legal oversight of the fund.

The Developer has asked to be paid $50,000 up front, and 50,000 XTM at the time of the ICO. Additionally, the Developer asks for $25,000 per year for support and maintenance of the Teleminx software.

The Marketer has asked to be paid $15,000 for the launch and ICO push, then $6,000 per year for regular marketing responsibilities.

### Projection

### ICO

20,000,000 XTM for $20,000,000 to be raised in BTC, DASH, USD and potentially other assets.

Operational funding for TeleMinx will come from a one month Initial Coin Offering (ICO). During this period, people will be able to commit funds into escrow. If the target of $20,000,000 is raised by the end of the ICO, then the contract will execute and the funds will be released to the Administrator to begin operations. If the target is not reached, the funds will be released from escrow back into the possession of the original owners.

The ICO is scheduled in sync with the code releases, and upon completing the ICO, the XTM tokens should be spendable.

+ DASH buyer

**Cash/Accounts**
+ Borrower bank account
++ send/receive SWIFT USD
+ TeleMinx bank account
++ send/receive SWIFT USD
+ TeleMinx CryptoCapital account
++ send/receive SWIFT USD (first party wire only)
++ send/receive CCUSD (CyptoCapital USD token)
+ DASH
++ Digital Cash (spending controled by key owner, no account)
+ CCUSD/XTM GuildExchange
++ buy/sell XTM for CCUSD
+ CCUSD/DASH GuildExchange
++ buy/sell DASH for CCUSD

**Funds Flow**
0. DASH owner decides to participate in TeleMinx ICO.
0a. DASH owner places an ask or market order on the CCUSD/DASH GuildExchange.
0b. CCUSD owner places a bid or market order on the CCUSD/DASH Guild Exchange.
0c. the orders cross, the CCUSD owner is now a DASH owner and the DASH owner is now a CCUSD owner.
1. TeleMinx places ask orders at various prices on the CCUSD/XTM orderbook.
1a. CCUSD owner places a market order on the CCUSD/XTM GuildExchange.
1b. TeleMinx becomes a CCUSD owner and CCUSD owner becomes a XTM owner.
2. XTM owners vote to approve borrower for loan offering.
