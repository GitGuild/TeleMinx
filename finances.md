## Lending Thesis 

TeleMinx will only make insured loans to underwrite contracts to buy and sell telecom credits or minutes.

Minutes are calculated as minutes per call to any destination or route worldwide. There is no buying or consignment stock - minutes are bought and sold in real time.

The borrower will utilize the funds to trade minutes via telecom exchanges (e.g. Route trader, Verteco, DSX, etc.) and/or via insured suppliers.

The borrower can employ various strategies to negotiate and execute deals which include directs, trade credit and swaps. A direct deal is a point to point solution that delivers a very stable route and with a substantial margin advantage. Trading credit can be attained based on the trading amount of the previous day which allows the borrower to establish and grow relationships with larger entities. A swap deal is a trade of equitable minutes or minute value where minimal to no money is required for settlement between trading counterparties at the end of the trading period, which mitigates cash flow pressure.

To mitigate risk, the borrower will never buy unless the route has been pre-sold.  Thus, no stock shall accumulate nor consequential penalties incurred should traffic fail or stop for any reason and no commitment beyond the real time traffic running will be made.

The the borrower utilizes one or more switch for implementing VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) to process the calling traffic.

## XTM token

Teleminx will issue a cryptograhic token utilizing the Gitguild Blockchain Protocol.

The ICO is scheduled in sync with the code releases, and upon completing the ICO, the XTM tokens will be spendable.

Initially, the Administrator will be paid a fee of 1.5% of the fund's net asset value, as well as a performance bonus of 20% all interest paid.

## ICO

Operational funding for TeleMinx will come from a one month Initial Coin Offering (ICO). During this period, people will be able to commit funds into escrow. If the target of 20,000,000 CCUSD is raised by the end of the ICO, then the contract will execute and the funds will be released to the Administrator to begin operations. If the target is not reached, the funds will be released from escrow back into the possession of the original owners.

20,000,000 XTM will be issued and placed as ask limit orders on the CCUSD/XTM GuildExchange for a target total raise of 20,000,000 CCUSD. The XTM ask limit orders will be placed in 5 tranches of 4,000,000 XTM each on the CCUSD/XTM orderbook at the following price points:

| Price        | XTM supply    |
|--------------|---------------|
| 0.9500 CCUSD | 4,000,000 XTM |
| 0.9750 CCUSD | 4,000,000 XTM |
| 1.0000 CCUSD | 4,000,000 XTM |
| 1.0250 CCUSD | 4,000,000 XTM |
| 1.0500 CCUSD | 4,000,000 XTM |

Utilisation of the GuildExchange for the ICO will enable efficient capital sourcing of assets other than CCUSD, e.g. BTC and DASH.
