# Economics

TeleMinx has a strict lending thesis. It will only make insured loans to underwrite contracts to buy and sell telecom credits or minutes.

Minutes are calculated as minutes per call to any destination or route worldwide. There is no buying or consignment stock - minutes are bought and sold in real time.

The borrower will utilize the funds to trade minutes via telecoms exchanges (e.g. Route trader, Verteco, DSX, etc.) and/or via insured suppliers.

The borrower can employ various strategies to negotiate and execute deals which include directs, trade credit and swaps. A direct deal is a point to point solution that delivers a very stable route and with a substantial margin advantage. Trading credit can be attained based on the trading amount of the previous day which allows the borrower to establish and grow relationships with larger entities. A swap deal is a trade of equitable minutes or minute value where minimal to no money is required for settlement between trading counterparties at the end of the trading period, which mitigates cash flow pressure.

To mitigate risk, the borrower will never buy unless the route has been pre-sold.  Thus, no stock shall accumulate nor consequential penalties incurred should traffic fail or stop for any reason and no commitment beyond the real time traffic running.

The the borrower utilizes one or more switch for implementing VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) to process the calling traffic.

### Projection

### ICO

20,000,000 XTM for $20,000,000 to be raised in BTC, DASH, USD and potentially other assets.

Operational funding for TeleMinx will come from a one month Initial Coin Offering (ICO). During this period, people will be able to commit funds into escrow. If the target of $20,000,000 is raised by the end of the ICO, then the contract will execute and the funds will be released to the Administrator to begin operations. If the target is not reached, the funds will be released from escrow back into the possession of the original owners.

The ICO is scheduled in sync with the code releases, and upon completing the ICO, the XTM tokens should be spendable.
