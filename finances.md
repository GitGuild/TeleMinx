## Lending Thesis 

TeleMinx will only make loans to underwrite contracts to buy and sell telecom credits or minutes.

Minutes are calculated as minutes per call to any destination or route worldwide. There is no buying or consignment stock - minutes are bought and sold in real time.

The borrower utilizes one or more switch for implementing VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) to process the calling traffic.

The borrower must be insured. The borrower will utilize the funds to trade minutes via insured telecom exchanges (e.g. Route trader, Verteco, DSX, etc.) and/or via insured counterparties.

The borrower can employ various strategies to negotiate and execute deals which include directs, trade credit and swaps. A direct deal is a point to point solution that delivers a very stable route and with a substantial margin advantage. Trading credit can be attained based on the trading amount of the previous day which allows the borrower to establish and grow relationships with larger entities. A swap deal is a trade of equitable minutes or minute value where minimal to no money is required for settlement between trading counterparties at the end of the trading period, which mitigates cash flow pressure.

To mitigate risk, the borrower will never buy unless the route has been pre-sold.  Thus, no stock shall accumulate nor consequential penalties incurred should traffic fail or stop for any reason and no commitment beyond the real time traffic running will be made.

### Risk Mitigation

The minimum qualifying amount for a TeleMinx loan contract is 1,000,000 CCUSD.

The maximum qualifying amount for a TeleMinx loan contract is 50% of the CCUSD TeleMinx has raised. That is, if TeleMinx has raised 20,000,000 CCUSD, the maximum loan amount is 10,000,000 CCUSD.

The lower bound of this range pursues to establish a reasonably substantial barrier to entry to render more effective the evaluation time and resources spent by XTM token holders

The upper bound of this range renders diversification as a risk management technique an imperative.

## XTM token

Teleminx will issue a cryptograhic token utilizing the Gitguild Blockchain Protocol.

The ICO is scheduled in sync with the code releases, and upon completing the ICO, the XTM tokens will be spendable.

## Revenue

*17%+ year interest rates on insured lending contracts to Borrowers*

## Costs

*$150,000 Seed Funding*

*$141,000 yearly fixed costs*

*1.5% yearly Administration Fee*

*Remainder split 80:20 between Token Holders and Administrator*

|          | Dividend Payments | Service Provider sub-total | Administrator | Auditor  | Council | Developer | Marketer | Token Holder |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------|----------|---------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Annually | $3,374,500        | $1,025,900             | $884,900      | $100,000 | $10,000 | $25,000   | $6,000   | $2,348,600   |

Initially, the Administrator will be paid a fee of 1.5% of the fund's net asset value, as well as a performance bonus of 20% all interest paid.

It is estimated that the Auditor will cost $25,000 at launch and $100,000 per year.

Initial legal costs by the Council are estimated at $10,000. And additionally, a $10,000 per year retainer will be paid to the Council, for arbitration and legal oversight of the fund.

The Developer has asked to be paid $50,000 up front, and 50,000 XTM at the time of the ICO. Additionally, the Developer asks for $25,000 per year for support and maintenance of the Teleminx software.

The Marketer has asked to be paid $15,000 for the launch and ICO push, then $6,000 per year for regular marketing responsibilities.


## Projection

## Dividends

Depending on the underlying contracts, dividends will be disbursed ranging from a quarterly to yearly basis, totalling 12%/year.

There is to be an 18 month post-ICO window of operation prior to the first dividend disbursement.

Dividend declarations will include an ex-dividend date.

## ICO

Operational funding for TeleMinx will come from a 60 day Initial Coin Offering (ICO). During this period, people will be able to commit funds into escrow. If the target of 20,000,000 CCUSD is raised by the end of the ICO, then the contract will execute and the funds will be released to the Administrator to begin operations. If the target is not reached, the funds will be released from escrow back into the possession of the original owners.

20,000,000 XTM will be issued and placed as ask limit orders on the CCUSD/XTM GuildExchange for a target total raise of 20,000,000 CCUSD. The XTM ask limit orders will be placed in 5 tranches of 4,000,000 XTM each on the CCUSD/XTM orderbook at the following price points:

| Price        | XTM supply    |
|--------------|---------------|
| 0.9000 CCUSD | 4,000,000 XTM |
| 0.9500 CCUSD | 4,000,000 XTM |
| 1.0000 CCUSD | 4,000,000 XTM |
| 1.0500 CCUSD | 4,000,000 XTM |
| 1.1000 CCUSD | 4,000,000 XTM |

The threshold for executing the contract is 12,000,000 XTM sold. That is, once the 12,000,000th XTM is bought, the CCUSD raised will be released to the TeleMinx Administrator and XTM holders can place ask or market sell orders on the CCUSD/XTM orderbook.

Utilisation of the GuildExchange for the ICO will enable efficient capital sourcing of assets other than CCUSD, e.g. BTC and DASH.
