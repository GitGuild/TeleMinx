# TeleMinx

TeleMinx is a decentralized lending fund focused on international telecom markets. The initial minimum lending rate will be 17% per annum. With an initial expected overhead of 5%, the fund is expected to pay out a minimum of 12% per annum in dividends.

TeleMinx will raise funds by issuing a crypto token (XTM) backed by USD denominated lending contracts and pay dividends. TeleMinx token holders will be assigned votes proportionate to the tokens they hold to decide on lending and policy decisions to be implemented by the protocol and/or the elected Administrator.

### Governance

The TeleMinx Token Holders will hold ultimate decision power over allocation of funds, including the issuance and destruction of XTM tokens, approving all roles, including Borrowers, and setting lending policies.

Voting will be done via the GitGuild Blockchain protocol. The following votes are expected as a minimum functional set.

+ Elect one Person or Corporation to each of the following roles: Administrator, Auditor, Council, Developer, Marketer
+ Vote yes or no on a Borrower application
+ Vote to issue new fixed tranche of XTM
+ Vote to initialize buy back of fixed tranche of XTM

Each vote will be considered legally binding by the Bylaws of the TeleMinx Foundation, and is to be put into action immediately.

### Roles

# Economics

TeleMinx has a strict lending thesis. It will only make insured loans to underwrite contracts to buy and sell telecom credits or minutes.

Minutes are calculated as minutes per call to any destination or route worldwide. There is no buying or consignment stock - minutes are bought and sold in real time.

The borrower will utilize the funds to trade minutes via telecoms exchanges (e.g. Route trader, Verteco, DSX, etc.) and/or via insured suppliers.

The borrower can employ various strategies to negotiate and execute deals which include directs, trade credit and swaps. A direct deal is a point to point solution that delivers a very stable route and with a substantial margin advantage. Trading credit can be attained based on the trading amount of the previous day which allows the borrower to establish and grow relationships with larger entities. A swap deal is a trade of equitable minutes or minute value where minimal to no money is required for settlement between trading counterparties at the end of the trading period, which mitigates cash flow pressure.

To mitigate risk, the borrower will never buy unless the route has been pre-sold.  Thus, no stock shall accumulate nor consequential penalties incurred should traffic fail or stop for any reason and no commitment beyond the real time traffic running.

The the borrower utilizes one or more switch for implementing VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) to process the calling traffic.

### Revenue

*17%+ year interest rates on insured lending contracts to Borrowers*

### Costs

*$150,000 Seed Funding*

*$141,000 yearly fixed costs*

*1.5% yearly Administration Fee*

*Remainder split 80:20 between Token Holders and Administrator*

|          | Interest Payments | Service Provider sub-total | Administrator | Auditor  | Council | Developer | Marketer | Token Holder |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------|----------|---------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Annually | $3,374,500        | $1,025,900             | $884,900      | $100,000 | $10,000 | $25,000   | $6,000   | $2,348,600   |

Initially, the Administrator will be paid a fee of 1.5% of the fund's net asset value, as well as a performance bonus of 20% all dividends issued.

It is estimated that the Auditor will cost $25,000 at launch and $100,000 per year.

Initial legal costs by the Council are estimated at $10,000. And additionally, a $10,000 per year retainer will be paid to the Council, for arbitration and legal oversight of the fund.

The Developer has asked to be paid $50,000 up front, and 50,000 XTM at the time of the ICO. Additionally, the Developer asks for $25,000 per year for support and maintenance of the Teleminx software.

The Marketer has asked to be paid $15,000 for the launch and ICO push, then $6,000 per year for regular marketing responsibilities.

### Projection

### ICO

20,000,000 XTM for $20,000,000 to be raised in BTC, DASH, USD and potentially other assets.

Operational funding for TeleMinx will come from a one month Initial Coin Offering (ICO). During this period, people will be able to commit funds into escrow. If the target of $20,000,000 is raised by the end of the ICO, then the contract will execute and the funds will be released to the Administrator to begin operations. If the target is not reached, the funds will be released from escrow back into the possession of the original owners.

The ICO is scheduled in sync with the code releases, and upon completing the ICO, the XTM tokens should be spendable.

# Voting Protocol

Voting is accounted for and managed using XP. The amount of XP per member is proportionate to the amount of XTM that member holds, i.e. if a member holds 100 XTM, that member has 100 XP.

The qualify as a borrower, the borrow must:
+ apply to register as a member of the Guild, i.e. sign a commit that creates a new member file that includes the member's public key.
+ sign a commit that creates the signed proposal of the borrower's terms

Once the proposal is submitted, the members will vote "Yes" by merging and gpg signing a vote proposal, or vote "No" by merging and gpg signing a corresponding dissent branch.

In addition to voting by merging and signing the commits of others, voters make explicit vote entries in the ledger. This makes counting of votes a trivial accounting matter, rather than a complex search through a forrest of branches. Each member is allowed to vote yes or no for each of their XP, and must record the XP spent on the vote as shown below.
